For this task I created an educational poster titled “Crypto Trends at a Glance”.
The goal was to give newcomers an easy, one‑screen overview of the sectors that currently drive innovation (and market narratives) in Web3, while keeping the design friendly and shareable.

Clean, vertical layout (Canva): A phone‑first format that works on Instagram Stories, X posts, and LinkedIn.
Color‑coded icons: Each trend―AI, RWA, Memecoins, Gaming, L1s, L2s, DeFi―has its own color + minimal icon, so viewers can scan in seconds.
One‑sentence explainer per trend	: Avoids jargon; answers the “why it matters” question for beginners.
